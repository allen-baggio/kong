This repo is the source code for a python Flask backend service that supports a basic service catalog.

It has 3 major API endpoints:
## /services
Get all services stored in the backend. It has 3 optional parameters:

#### `query`: input query to filter the results. The results only include services which name or description contains the query.

#### `page`: the number of pages to return

#### `page_length`: the number of cards returned in a single page. Default value is 12 if not specified.

The return order is the reverse order of the created date

## /service/<service_id>

 Get a single service given a service_id. Return empty payload if no service has been found.

## /add_service
Add a single service with name and description to the backend storage. It has 2 input parameters:
#### `name`: the name of the service. This is required and can't be empty.
#### `description`: the description of the service. This is optional.

The API response format is defined in **representation.py**

## Here are the steps to run the program and test:

### Install python flask (skip if you already have flask installed)

`$ pip install Flask`

### Start the server

`$ python api.py`

### Create new services

`$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"test11", "description": "This is test 11"}' localhost:5000/add_service`

`$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"test22", "description": "This is test 22"}' localhost:5000/add_service`

`$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"test33", "description": "This is test 33"}' localhost:5000/add_service`

### List all services

`$ curl http://localhost:5000/services`

This can be done in a browser as well

### List a specific service

`$ curl http://localhost:5000/service/<service_id>`

This can be done in a browser as well
